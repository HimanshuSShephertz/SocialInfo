__Fetching Social Information through Rest API and creating single session for App through Custom code sample__ 

This custom code has been written on the top Rest API to get the user information like his email id, name, profile url etc. On the basis of that information we create one user into App42 data base and maintain a single session id for multiple login and all information is bind with user profile. Here we have integrated GitHub, FaceBook, LinkedIn and Google. If user wants to login with every account than he can use it easily.
